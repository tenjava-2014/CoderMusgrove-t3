Information
-----------

New events can now occur in Minecraft! This is to challenge the survival aspect, and just add a bit of randomness to it.
Some of the Random Events include:
- Lightning randomly striking down
- A creeper spawning at any time 
- A random day of raining dogs 
- Lava randomly spawning in stone!
- Hitting an entity and getting flown backwards!
- While swimming, you could experience a wave!
- A random bonus chest to help you out along your way
- Randomly taking a poop for some quick relief
- You randomly fall into a sink hole.
- Sometimes you will be lifted by wind, it gets gusty outside!
- Angry wolves will spawn and attack you to protect their territory!

Note that all of the features are configurable, as in you can enable or disable them, via the config! All events happen near a player.
Don't grow too attached to your house, a sinkhole might spawn in it.
